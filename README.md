# GstHub 👩‍🎓👩‍💻
‘Gsthub – threading ties between Gstians’ is a forum mobile application specific to only SIES GST, where not only the students but also the teachers, alumni and guest users can participate actively in discussions, etc. Along with this, we have made a few additions to our app such as the classroom section and the dashboard section. The classroom section is made specifically for the SIES GST family. In this section, the teachers can post assignments, notes, etc. This will make it easier for the students to receive and keep track of all sorts of updates. The dashboard section will display the most popular posts that have been put up on our forum. This will keep the users informed about the most important and engaging discussions taking place in our college. The methodology adopted in our project is Rapid Application Development. The prototype mobile application is built in Android OS using Android Studio with Java Programming. The database used for our application is the Firebase Realtime Database and the authentication is carried out through Firebase as well.
